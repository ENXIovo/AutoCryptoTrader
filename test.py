test = {"message":"### **Detailed Text Analysis**\n\n#### 1. **Long-Term Technical Analysis (Multi-Timeframe)**\n\n##### **4-hour (240m)**:\n- **RSI**: 53.86 (neutral to slightly bullish sentiment).\n- **MACD**: The MACD line is slightly below the signal line (-32.29), indicating weakening momentum, but it is still in positive territory.\n- **Bollinger Bands**: Price is near the midline of the bands (87040.78 middle), with the upper band at 89272.36 and the lower band at 84809.20. This suggests moderate volatility.\n- **ATR**: 982.04, indicating a moderate range for 4-hour price movements.\n\n##### **Daily (1D)**:\n- **RSI**: 59.01, suggesting the market is in a bullish phase but not yet overbought.\n- **MACD**: Bullish momentum as the MACD histogram is positive (+898.81), with the MACD line above the signal line.\n- **Bollinger Bands**: Price is approaching the upper band (89154.55). The middle band is 84247.65, and the lower band is 79340.75. This indicates a bullish trend with significant room for pullbacks.\n- **ATR**: 2667.84, signaling high daily volatility, requiring wider stop-losses and take-profits.\n\n##### **Weekly (1W)**:\n- **RSI**: Not provided but can be inferred to be bullish given the higher timeframe's trend.\n- **Price Context**: Weekly structure suggests a strong bullish trend, with higher highs and higher lows.\n- **Key Levels**: \n  - Resistance near $90,000 based on psychological levels and historical price action.\n  - Support around $84,000-$85,000 (previous consolidation zone).\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Support, Resistance & Volatility (Long-Term)**\n\n##### **Key Support Levels**:\n1. **$84,000 - $85,000** (High importance): Historical support zone confirmed by weekly consolidation and Bollinger Band middle on the daily chart.\n2. **$79,300 - $79,500** (Medium importance): Daily Bollinger lower band and prior swing low.\n\n##### **Key Resistance Levels**:\n1. **$89,000 - $90,000** (High importance): Psychological level and upper daily Bollinger Band.\n2. **$87,500 - $88,000** (Medium importance): Price is currently testing resistance here.\n\n**Volatility**:\n- Daily ATR indicates high volatility. This supports the need for wide stops (3–6× ATR) and take-profits (5–10× ATR).\n- Position sizing should be smaller than normal due to the elevated volatility.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Account Status & Liquidity**\n\n- **Available Liquidity**: The account has $131.68 USD available and **-2.99 BTC** due to leveraged positions. With only 0.15% of total equity as available liquidity, the account is at **high liquidity risk**.\n- **Unrealized PnL**: Current unrealized profit of +1.87% indicates the account is in a slightly profitable position, but tight liquidity limits the ability to open new positions.\n- **Order Calculations**:\n  - Buy orders must not exceed $131.68.\n  - Existing short positions (negative BTC holdings) are highly leveraged, and stop-loss/take-profit orders are essential for risk management.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Order Recommendations**\n\n##### **Existing Orders**:\n\n1. **Order ID: OOCFDG-XSYH4-G3WU22 (Sell Stop-Loss @ $72,000)**  \n   - **Recommendation**: Hold. While far from the current price, it aligns with a critical stop-loss level below daily support ($79,300-$79,500).\n\n2. **Order ID: OLC67L-X6RJ6-P2VVMS (Sell Take-Profit @ $86,000)**  \n   - **Recommendation**: Modify to $88,000. Current price is already at $87,500, and the take-profit level is too close to current resistance. Adjusting to $88,000 aligns with medium resistance.\n\n3. **Order ID: OQ2MHX-CCDIV-QAL74Z (Buy Limit @ $78,888)**  \n   - **Recommendation**: Hold. This is near daily Bollinger lower band support and provides an excellent entry for a pullback.\n\n4. **Order ID: OY7PFB-7FPR3-IW54VK (Sell Stop-Loss @ $70,000)**  \n   - **Recommendation**: Cancel. This is too far from any significant support and unlikely to trigger soon. Free up liquidity.\n\n5. **Order ID: OAOAGI-VF37X-SGXX7Z (Sell Take-Profit @ $88,000)**  \n   - **Recommendation**: Hold. This aligns with medium resistance.\n\n6. **Order ID: OMO27X-A2TBC-D3UCK4 (Buy Limit @ $76,182)**  \n   - **Recommendation**: Hold. This is slightly below daily support ($79,300-$79,500) and could capture a deeper retracement.\n\n7. **Order ID: OLG47G-WKG77-AP5KGO (Sell Stop-Loss @ $76,400)**  \n   - **Recommendation**: Hold. It aligns with current significant support levels.\n\n8. **Order ID: OVUGL3-WC7FS-6RTBP7 (Sell Take-Profit @ $90,000)**  \n   - **Recommendation**: Hold. This aligns with the weekly resistance level.\n\n---\n\n#### **New Orders**:\n\n1. **Proposed Order**: Buy Limit  \n   - **Price**: $84,500 (near daily support).  \n   - **Volume**: 0.001 BTC ($84.50).  \n   - **Reasoning**: Long-term buy opportunity at a strong support level.  \n   - **Stop-Loss**: $81,500 (3× ATR below).  \n   - **Take-Profit**: $89,000 (5× ATR above).  \n   - **Risk Assessment**: Medium.  \n\n---\n\n### **JSON Output**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"key_levels\": {\n    \"support\": [\n      {\n        \"range\": \"$84,000 - $85,000\",\n        \"timeframe\": \"daily/weekly\",\n        \"importance\": \"high\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Historical support zone and Bollinger Band middle.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"range\": \"$79,300 - $79,500\",\n        \"timeframe\": \"daily\",\n        \"importance\": \"medium\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Daily Bollinger lower band and prior swing low.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"resistance\": [\n      {\n        \"range\": \"$89,000 - $90,000\",\n        \"timeframe\": \"daily/weekly\",\n        \"importance\": \"high\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Psychological level and upper daily Bollinger Band.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"range\": \"$87,500 - $88,000\",\n        \"timeframe\": \"daily\",\n        \"importance\": \"medium\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Current price testing resistance.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"recommendations\": {\n    \"orders\": [\n      {\n        \"order_id\": \"OOCFDG-XSYH4-G3WU22\",\n        \"pair\": \"XBTUSD\",\n        \"type\": \"sell\",\n        \"price\": \"72000.0\",\n        \"vol\": \"0.00116354\",\n        \"action\": \"hold\",\n        \"status\": \"pending\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Critical stop-loss level below daily support.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"order_id\": \"OLC67L-X6RJ6-P2VVMS\",\n        \"pair\": \"XBTUSD\",\n        \"type\": \"sell\",\n        \"price\": \"86000.0\",\n        \"vol\": \"0.00116354\",\n        \"action\": \"modify\",\n        \"status\": \"pending\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Too close to current price.
